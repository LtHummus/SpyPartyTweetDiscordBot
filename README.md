# SpyPartyTweetDiscordBot

This is just a simple little tool for the [SpyParty Discord](http://discord.gg/spyparty). There's just a Twitter account called @SpyPartyStreams that posts when people are streaming. This takes those tweets and posts them to Discord via a webhook. It also suppresses the thumbnail for new streamers and shows it for streamers that have streamed the game a few times (configurable).
